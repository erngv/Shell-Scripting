# Shell Scripting & Practice with `git` 

## This repository includes some basic Shell Scripting practice programs that contain concepts introduced in the COMP290 tools course.

### `did-duke-win`

The usage of the shell script found in this project is:

`did-duke-win [test-url]`

Running the command with an option of `--help` will display its usage.

### `jrep`

This project implements both a Java and a Shell Script program in a simple command-line utility program named `jrep`. Its implementation is similar to `grep`, however, it only matches against exact matching strings.

The program takes one argument and then read lines from standard input while printing lines that contain the search string.

### `make`

This project was a practice exercise which consisted in creating a simple `Makefile` for a C programming project.
